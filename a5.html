      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with combining two meshes to print. Upon perusing Thingivers, I found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:329436/files">this frog</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6569703/files">this mushroom</a> which I thought would be cute to combine. Luckily the meshes were in good shape, so they were very simple to combine in Rhino.</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Then comes the bad part. Earlier this week, I had tried to 3D print some things for my house and I was having issues with the prints staying stuck to the board. Life got in the way so I stopped working on those prints to work on this assignment, so I leveled the print bed again and tried and ran my print with little thought. The print inevitably became detached...</p>

    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <p>I was frustrated but I cleaned the print bed, releveled, and applied some good ol' Paul Mitchell. I also did a small bit of research, which suggested I increase the temperature of my print bed (I increased the temperature from 50° C to 65°C) and slow down the initial layer print speed (I decreased it to 5 mm/s). Things were going well, so I let the print run over night. When I woke up, the cursed spirals had replaced what was supposed to be a cute frog:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <p>I then took to Discord, where Eva recommended a glass print bed, which I ordered but it did not come in time to be relevant for this assignment, and Nathan suggested some recalibration to my print settings again. I decreased the bed temperature to 60° C, scaled the print down so that it was a shorter print, applied glue to the print bed, and prayed. I had little success:</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>At this point I was extremely frustrated, so I went back to the drawing board and changed my meshes. Instead of a mushroom that was a tall print, I used <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6557556">this Thingiverse makeup brush cleaner</a> as a funky new lily pad for my frog. I scaled the print down to reduce the print to only taking an hour long and finally... success:</p>

      <p>I then turned my efforts to working on the lamp. Jaimie had suggested that Fusion 360 was easier to work with, so I downloaded it and started playing around. I found this tool way easier to work with and started playing with some ideas for the lamp:</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I started by making the cap of my lamp in Fusion 360:</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2963410/files">this Thingiverse lamp shade</a> that I was going to print and design a cap to go over it, but this print was going to take almost three days and I simply did not have time for that. I may explore this kind of lamp shade for my final project, but for now I skipped it.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Sticking with the cap idea, I designed a lampshade that was 43 mm across at the top, 153 mm high, and 120 mm across at the bottom that could slide over the cord of this lamp and rest on the light, held in place by gravity. The first time I printed the lamp, I somehow accidentally made the walls of the lampshade too thin to the point that it did not print.

    <div class="header">
      <p>The final lampshade slid easily over the end of the lamp plug and rested perflectly as I had envisioned it.</p>
