    <h1>Assignment 5: Combining Meshes & Lamps Part 1!</h1>
    <p>Here is my first frog iteration Rhino file and Cura file, here is my second frog iteration Rhino file and Cura file, and here is my lamp Fusion 365 file and Cura file.</p>

      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with combining two meshes to print. Upon perusing Thingivers, I found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:329436/files">this frog</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6569703/files">this mushroom</a> which I thought would be cute to combine. Luckily the meshes were in good shape, so they were very simple to combine in Rhino.</p>

      <p>Then comes the bad part. Earlier this week, I had tried to 3D print some things for my house and I was having issues with the prints staying stuck to the board. Life got in the way so I stopped working on those prints to work on this assignment, so I leveled the print bed again and tried and ran my print with little thought. The print inevitably became detached...</p>

      <p>I was frustrated but I cleaned the print bed, releveled, and applied some good ol' Paul Mitchell. I also did a small bit of research, which suggested I increase the temperature of my print bed (I increased the temperature from 50° C to 65°C) and slow down the initial layer print speed (I decreased it to 5 mm/s). Things were going well, so I let the print run over night. When I woke up, the cursed spirals had replaced what was supposed to be a cute frog:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <p>I then took to Discord, where Eva recommended a glass print bed, which I ordered but it did not come in time to be relevant for this assignment, and Nathan suggested some recalibration to my print settings again. I decreased the bed temperature to 60° C, scaled the print down so that it was a shorter print, applied glue to the print bed, and prayed. I had little success:</p>

      <p>At this point I was extremely frustrated, so I went back to the drawing board and changed my meshes. Instead of a mushroom that was a tall print, I used <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6557556">this Thingiverse makeup brush cleaner</a> as a funky new lily pad for my frog. I scaled the print down to reduce the print to only taking an hour long and finally... success:</p>

      <p>I then turned my efforts to working on the lamp. Jaimie had suggested that Fusion 365 was easier to work with, so I downloaded it and started playing around. I found this tool way easier to work with and started playing with some ideas for the lamp:</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I did not try to print any pieces for the lamp because I was waiting for my glass print plate to arrive, but I did order some special 3D printing glue and 4 new spools of filament which I will be using for my lamp print. My new print plate arrived today so I will begin testing this week!</p>
