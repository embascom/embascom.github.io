      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked to design 30 identical pieces to be laser cut that would fit together to create a structure that could withstand light shaking. After reviewing previous students' assignments and browing the internet, I decided on a hexigonal piece with slots as my design. I measured my carboard to be 0.195 inches thick, and decided to size the slots down to 0.19 inches to make the slots fit tight together because the cardboard had a lot of give. See here the process I went through to design my piece in cutter.xyz.</p>

      <p>Next, I journeyed to the Mill where Eva was EXTREMELY helpful in walking me through how to set up the laser cutter and provided me very valuable suggestions and problem solving tips for how calibrate the printer. In the end, I used 20X50X50 as my settings and each print required two to three passes. Here is an aesthetic video of my pieces printing.</p>

      <p>Finally, I assembled my laser cut pieces into a weird globe-like thing? See here it withstanding a shake test. It got the stamp of approval as a hat for my frenchie Lola, and passed the sniff test from my cat Cillian.</p>
