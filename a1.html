      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked to design 30 identical pieces to be laser cut that would fit together to create a structure that could withstand light shaking. After reviewing previous students' assignments and browing the internet, I decided on a hexigonal piece with slots as my design. See here the process I went through to design my piece.</p>
