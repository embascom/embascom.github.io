      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked recreating our A1 assignment in Rhino and Grasshopper, leveraging parametric modelling. Through this video, you can see I got most of the core functionality in Grasshopper, but I was getting increasingly frustrated trying to get the slots to line up properly when changing the number of sides to the polygon. Ultimately I caved and completed the assignment in Rhino where trimmed the remaining sides to complete my shapes and duplicated the shapes to make the 5X6 grid.</p>
