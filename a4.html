      <p><a href="https://evabean.github.io/digital-fabrication-S24/">Eva Schipper</a> was absolutely essential to my success this week. I was out sick and Eva gave me all the tips and tricks on how to tackle this assignment and get it done, so thank you Eva!</p>

      Last week, I tackled assembling my Ender 3 3D printer which proved to be quite the endeavor. It took me a little over 4 hours to complete, and I relied HEAVILY on this walkthrough by CHEP on YouTube. The most challenging aspect of the 3D printer set up was getting all of the cross bars to be completely straight, which resulted in me disassembling and reassembling different components of the 3D printer while I was setting it up.

      <p>For me, leveling was the simplest part where I again used one of Chuck's videos. I used this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3235018">Thingaverse file</a>  to go along with the video. The only thing I had to do after this initial print was calibrate the board slightly further down away from the nozzle because the pieces were adhereing a little too well.</p>

      <p>I then created some of the objects for A3 but did not get to finish making the all the variations of cylinders and my clips, hence why this information is included in my A4 documentation! Here is a picture of the few objects I made.</p>

      <p>Taking advice from Eva, I started off A4 by creating this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4644465">Fit Tolerance Board</a> by @oliverphillips2 on Thingaverse. This was super helpful to understand more about the tolerance of my printer and get a better idea of how I should go about my print.</p>

      <p>Leveraging this tutorial, I created a simplified version of the finger joint box the creator, Effie Jai, made. I was really struggling to create the box in Rhino, so this was extremely helpful for me.</p>

      <p>For my first print, I used the Low setting in Cura just to make sure I did not spend too much time printing a design that did not work. As you can see below, the first print generally was well fit together, but it was really difficult to assemble and had some small gaps where the pieces joined together.</p>

      <p>I reprinted the pieces using the Dynamic setting in Cura to see if this would help with some of the fit issues. It actually had the opposite impact and was WAY harder to assemble then the previous version, so I will have to go back to the drawing board for this one!</p>
