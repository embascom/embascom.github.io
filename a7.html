    <h1>Assignment 7: Final Project Proposal!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>Project Description</h1>
      <p>Earlier this quarter, my partner and I moved into a new apartment that is bigger and has an additional bathroom. Because of this, we are in need of some furnishings that luckily can be 3D printed. For my final project, I am going to create the things we need through a combination of my own designs and designs from Thingiverse.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>Design</h1>
      <p>I will be creating the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1× bar soap holder</li>
        <li>1× liquid dish soap holder</li>
        <li>2× q-tip holders</li>
        <li>2× cotton round holders</li>
        <li>1× toothbrush holder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a stretch goal, I would also like to create the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Various hooks for throughout the apartment</li>
        <li>Various drawers dividers for the kitchen and bathroom</li>
        <li>Various cat toys for my little babies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>Methods</h1>
      <p> For my project, I will use the following techniques and tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rhino - For modeling and editing my designs</li>
        <li>Fusion 360 - For modeling and editing my designs</li>
        <li>3D printing - To actually create my pieces and positives for my mold</li>
        <li>Silicon Modeling and Plaster Casting - To create the pieces that I do not 3D print</li>
    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>Schedule</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Week 1: May 13 to May 19 - Look through Thingiverse and select what I want to use from that resource versus what I want to design fom scratch</li>
        <li>Week 2: May 20 to May 26 - Have all of my Rhino/Fusion360 files complete and have almost all, if not all pieces printed and/or molded</li>
        <li>Week 3: May 27 to May 31 - Have all pieces ready to present for the final project and submit all necessary documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
