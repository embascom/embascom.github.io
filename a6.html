      <p>Here is my first mold <a href="https://github.com/embascom/embascom.github.io/blob/main/A6/CE3E3V2_mold.3mf">Cura file</a>, final mold <a href="">Rhino file</a>, and final mold <a href="">Cura file</a>. </p>

      <p>For this assignment, I wanted to make a mold of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:756968">this Thingiverse Hexagonal Candle Holder</a>. I envisioned it to be a fairly simple mold to make and would beneift my endless supply of candles I have at home.</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I went about designing the initial mold in Rhino, where I leveraged the <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/features/mold-making-tools/">video Rene suggested</a> and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printing-for-Two-Part-Silicone-Molds/">this walkthrough that I found</a>. I had gotten most of the way through the process to the point where I exported the file to Cura to see how long it would take to print. I realized that I put the pouring hole in the wrong place and went back to fix it only for my Rhino to crash taking my file down with it :,)))))</p>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I then redesigned the mold, more properly designing it with a rectangular frame to make it easier to pour the silicone and placing the pour spout in a place that actually makes sense. </p>
